# Machine_Learning-
here are some machine learning example projects .

## First
For text classification(positive or negative) the dataset can be downloaded from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/

## second
The second project deals with the spam or ham classification of sms. Accuracies of different classifying algorithmns is compared in this and the SVC classifier with linear (kernal) outperform others. The dataset is attached in the folder.

## third
Using Classifiaction technique for cancer classification.

## Fourth
Exploratory and predictive analysis of Wines.It is an end to end Exploration of features using effective visualization techniques and model comparision on binary and tertiary classification.

## Fifth
Loan Default Prediction using roc-auc metric for evalution.
This is a solution file for LTFS Data Science Challenge.
